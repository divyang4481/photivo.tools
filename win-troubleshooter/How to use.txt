Photivo Crash Troubleshooter
----------------------------

This archive contains the Photivo crash troubleshooter for Windows. Use it when
Photivo crashes or just disappears (which is a crash as well) to generate additional
information about what happened. This is always useful for the developers to quickly 
find the cause of the problem.

How to use?
1. You need to have Photivo installed.
2. Copy the files from this archive to your Photivo program folder.
   It's usually "C:\Program Files\Photivo" or something very similar.
3. From the Photivo program folder run "ptTroubleshoot.bat" and follow the
   instructions there.
