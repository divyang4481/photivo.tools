!!! DO NOT USE THE SCRIPTS IN THIS FOLDER AS IS !!!

These scripts are my (Brother John's) build and package scripts for MinGW/Msys.
They are customized for my machines and probably will not run properly
elsewhere.

If you want to adapt them to your system and need some pointers about the
assumptions they make, contact me: brjohn@brother-john.net
But make sure you read and understand them first.

Note that these scripts are *not* GPL licenced like the rest of Photivo. In fact,
you may do with them whatever you like. No restrictions.

Some documentation follows. To be put in the wiki later.

===Environment variables===
''GccArch'' \\
The architecture binaries are created for. Must be either ''32'' or ''64''. Assumes you’re using separate toolchains and Msyses for 32bit and 64bit.

''GccVersion'' \\
The GCC version number.

''ProjectsBasePath'' \\
The base path where all your projects are located. If not set defaults to ''/C/Projekte'' via ''profile.include''.

''RepoDefaultDir'' \\
The default folder name for your main repository. Defaults to ''repository'' via ''profile.include''.

''JobsForMake'' \\
The number of jobs to use for ''make''. 

''PhotivoRepoId'' \\
The short name that identifies a repository with ''setrepo'' and is displayed in the prompt.

''PhotivoRepoPath'' \\
Set by ''setrepo''. Full path to the active repository.

''PhotivoBuildPath'' \\
Set by ''setrepo'' to ''$PhotivoRepoPath/build-$GccArch''. The scripts always build Photivo out-of-source. This is the path where the files generated by the build process are located: makefiles, object files, final binaries, etc.


  * The scripts assume that your main Photivo repository is located at ''$ProjectsBasePath/Photivo/$RepoDefaultDir''. For the default case that translates to ''/C/Projekte/Photivo/repository''.
  * You must not use spaces your paths! The scripts do not make sure paths containing spaces are properly quoted.
